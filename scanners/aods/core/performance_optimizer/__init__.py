AODS Performance Optimizer - Professional Modular Architecture

Enterprise-scale performance optimization framework with intelligent caching,
memory management, and parallel processing capabilities. Transforms 1,388-line
monolithic implementation into focused, testable components.

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES:
- Maximum analysis speed with intelligent caching systems
- Memory efficiency through professional resource management
- Parallel processing optimization for enterprise workloads
- monitoring and metrics collection
- Zero emoji, enterprise-appropriate logging and status reporting

Modular Components:
- performance_metrics.py: Full performance tracking and analysis
- intelligent_cache.py: Advanced caching system with persistence
- memory_manager.py: memory management and optimization
- parallel_processor.py: Intelligent parallel processing framework
- resource_manager.py: Optimized resource allocation and management
- optimized_pipeline.py: Main performance optimization orchestrator
- data_structures.py: Core performance data types and metrics
- configuration_manager.py: Performance-aware configuration management

Original monolithic implementation has been successfully replaced by this modular architecture.
