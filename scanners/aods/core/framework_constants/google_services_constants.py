"""
Google Services Framework Constants - Focused Single Source of Truth

This module contains ALL Google Services-specific constants in one focused location.
Extracted from framework_constants.py to maintain <500 lines per file.

ZERO DUPLICATION: All Google Services patterns centralized here.
SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY: Google Services constants only.
